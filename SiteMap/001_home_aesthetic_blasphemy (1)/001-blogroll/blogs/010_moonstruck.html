<title>Moonstruck!!</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>Waters of  earth sway as if being your partner at the cosmic ball. The goodness in some  reaches you to leave a ware wolf behind. Some lovers are moonstruck and have  fits of epilepsy. &nbsp;All I do is admire you  grow and then watch you decline.</p>
<p>Waters sway  in trance with a cosmic ball,<br />
  The  goodness in men seems to fall,<br />
  Revealing  the warewolf within.</p>
<p>As the  night draws its shroud all around,<br />
  Sometimes  in enchantment, as I recline,<br />
  I watch you  grow, and then decline.</p>
<p>A shining  eye, an eternally scarred face, <br />
  A  reflection of the light,<br />
  From outer  space.</p>
<p>Mute, yet animate,  tantalizing, artwork so fine,<br />
  Your  unpretentious face aint a silly design,<br />
  A  reminiscent of the past.</p>
<p>But moon o  mine, why so indifferent to me?<br />
  Always showing  the same face, never letting me see,<br />
  Through, to  the other side.</p>
<p>My love for  you, is pure, though obscure,<br />
  Like a dew  drop on a fresh morning, hanging<br />
  Delicately  through a spider&rsquo;s web.</p>
<p>Now that  you are far, love is something, I can&rsquo;t make,<br />
  And with  this tumultuous explosion of emotions,<br />
  Expression  is something, I can&rsquo;t fake!</p>
<p>So hear my  plea, for all I want is your trust in me,<br />
  And I shall  be with you forever, when time sets me free, <br />
  I shall be  bound to you, for eternity.</p>
<p>As I behold  your image in my tiny eyes,<br />
  People laugh,  saying I am inflicted, with a Cupid&rsquo;s bug,<br />
  They don&rsquo;t  believe me when I say, I am just,</p>
<p>Moonstruck!</p>
<p>But moon o  moon, why are you so indifferent to me? Always showing me the same face every  day. Don&rsquo;t you trust me? Are you afraid of showing me your other side? Trust me  my love, my moon.</p>
<p>As I behold your image in my tiny eyes,<br />
  People laugh, saying I am inflicted, with a Cupid&rsquo;s bug,<br />
  They don&rsquo;t believe me when I say, I am just,<br />
  <br />
  Moonstruck!<br />
