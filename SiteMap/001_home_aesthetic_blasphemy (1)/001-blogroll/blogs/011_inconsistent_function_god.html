<title>God is an Inconsistent Function!</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>God! The topic of endless debates. A mystery  that has led to many conspiracy theories, whose followers call them, &lsquo;Religion&rsquo;.  Some say He&rsquo;s &lsquo;<em>nirankaar</em>&rsquo; (formless) while others believe in His  definite form. Sometimes, He comes as a child to take away your sorrows, and  sometimes, in a form incomprehensible, to obliterate evil. Some say He&rsquo;s  omnipresent, and can be seen wherever we wish to and in any form, while some  believe He never descended the stairs of heaven. Communication was through  messengers or sometimes He sent his Son, when matters were grave. Well  nowadays, He cannot possibly risk sending Emails for they&rsquo;ll be treated as  spam. And if He sends SMS then maybe, vandals keep giving him missed phone calls.  Am not sure of the network connectivity in heaven either! (I am constantly  updated with activities going on in hell, so no network problem there).<br />
  There&rsquo;s another group with the most different  notion, &ldquo;God is an inconsistent function&rdquo;. They propound the theory that God is  a creation of human brain, quite the other way round to most of religious  beliefs. I have had an experience of a few interpretations and I remember two  of those. Well read carefully, because the people who narrated them are highly religious  and also highly scientific. They believe in God but tried to interpret him  within scientific bounds.<br />
  <strong>Hanuman: </strong>Ancient people were great scientists. Science  made great progress in olden times. The people we call Saints (&lsquo;<em>Munis&rsquo;)</em> today were experimenters then. <em>&lsquo;Havan</em>&rsquo; was a chemistry experiment to  study the properties of various organic materials when subjected to pyrolysis.  The results and observations of these experiments were encoded as scriptures in  form of beautiful and narrative stories, so that the immense power of those  findings did not fall into wrong hands. <em>&lsquo;Asurs&rsquo;</em> were similar scientists  bent towards destruction and &lsquo;<em>Surs&rsquo; </em>or <em>&rsquo;Devas&rsquo; </em>were the most  enlightened scientists who made their facilities up in the air. Weapons were  far more sophisticated than America can build today (think of Brahmastra). But  the knowledge was lost as the brain size shrank and this is where we all are  today, still trying to catch up with ancient times. &lsquo;<strong>Hanuman</strong>&rsquo; is a Deva,  who descended down to earth to protect the Munis from Asurs. And how he came to  be symbolized as a Monkey form? He was the pioneer in flying. He indigenously  devised a jetpack. Now as every propulsion machine has an exhaust line, his  exhaust became his tail. While flying at high speeds in air, anything small can  damage you, even dust can wreck your face. So he had to wear a mask. And silly  we, interpreted him as a flying monkey. <br />
  <strong>Ganesha</strong>: The God who is worshipped before any other  God in any Hindu religion&rsquo;s function. Well, he is really huge, has a head of  Elephant, has a protruding tummy and still, rides a rat. Strange? I find every  religion strange for some of their ways; this one&rsquo;s far more interesting than  absurd. He&rsquo;s the lord of prosperity and &lsquo;<em>Riddhi&rsquo; </em>and &lsquo;<em>Siddhi&rsquo; </em>accompany  him. Legend says that He was beheaded by his own father, Lord <em>Shiva, </em>when  He stopped Shiva from visiting mother <em>Parvati </em>in her<em> &lsquo;snaanagaar&rsquo;  (bath)</em>, as per her request. Later, due to Parvati&rsquo;s insistence and anger,  they had to put him back in one piece. So they used an elephant&rsquo;s head. Now,  theorists found it fundamentally wrong. How can a massive head be put on a  small human body? There were concerns of stability and about centre of gravity  shifting, making the whole body unstable. So, they augmented his body with a  big fat protrusion around the belly. And this is how he came to be worshipped  in his present form.</p>
<p>Regarding the rat being his carrier, my  narrators did not mention anything, neither did I ask.<br />
  *I know my Lord understands me and what I mean. So I won&rsquo;t apologize to  anyone if I hurt them through this Post. Jai Hanuman!</p>
