<title>A Utopian Dream</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>Tonight I  walk,<br />
  In  incredulous realms, <br />
  Its words  unspoken, <br />
  Its lands  unseen, <br />
  I sway in  the rhythms,<br />
  Of dancing  rivulets, <br />
  And sing  along,<br />
  The mystic  streams.</p>
<p>Through the  feathery clouds, <br />
  Amidst the  azure of a distant canvas,<br />
  The seven  horsed charioteer,<br />
  With  unimpeachable balmy gleam,<br />
  Instills in  me new exuberance,<br />
  And I, like  a child rambunctious,<br />
  Try  unhiding my playful shadow, <br />
  Deprived so  long to his love serene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;My heart, like young horses, Leaps in frenzy, <br />
  Through  deep trenches and over the fences,<br />
  Kicking the  snow over lofty peaks,<br />
  Sails over  the rivulets like a mighty air stream.<br />
  A commotion  in the shrubs and all eyes set, <br />
  A pebble  tips me over, I let out a scream,<br />
  With a  shrug I open my eyes,<br />
  &nbsp;To wake up from a utopian dream!</p>
