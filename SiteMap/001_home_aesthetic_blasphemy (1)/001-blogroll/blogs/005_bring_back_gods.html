<title>Bring back God!</title>

<p>God&rsquo;s a sensation, God&rsquo;s a hit. God is the  genie for us misfits. But alike all, shall God too fall?<br />
  God is a celebrity, more glamorous than any  celebrity that has ever walked on earth. God is worshipped in different  attires, in different roles he has played, in different avatars he has  manifested. God is a fabulous and versatile actor and maybe that is why, God is  most sought after on earth.<br />
  Since ages when sense of time was limited to sunrises  and sunsets, there has been a constant belief in some unfathomable entity. God!  No one sees God nowadays, but still a majority believes in his existence.<br />
  God has grown very shy of people. Rarely does  he give public appearances, and even less frequently does he meet people in  person. At some time in the past, when God was ordinary, God must have been  walked among the crowds. People must have interacted with him, and known him.  That must have been the time when everyone loved everyone, when hearts were  clear like a see through glass.&nbsp; God just  needed to sit back and relax, as everyone was doing well. Then came the poison  called jealousy. Some mortals became jealous of God. They conspired to seclude  him from the world. They started propagating the notion of worship. They  started rumours of divinity, of chastity, of purity, of God&rsquo;s superiority. <br />
  God could no longer roam about freely in the  streets of earth, for He was chased for petty needs. Some asked for food, some  for wealth, few asked for power but none asked for his company. God must have  been in agony to see his dearest creation getting entangled in such incredulous  webs of desires. Unwillingly, God had to flee. <br />
  He fled to the high hill tops. From there, he  looked over the village below. Times changed. Being a super celebrity, God  needed no advertisement. A simple wish granted, and the word spread like  wildfire. People start congregating because of the poison that had been seeded  into them. This added to God&rsquo;s problems. There was a time when he could sit  there for a while and see everyone down the slope, now God needed to crane his  neck to notice each person coming to him as all were on his ground level. So he  decided to leave again.<br />
  He fled to the highest peaks on earth; he fled  to the darkest caverns. God wanted only the worthy to find him. But how could  he abandon his loved ones? Everywhere he went, he left some trail, hoping that  someone would come searching for him just for the sake of meeting him. Contrary  to his expectations, people built temples there stating, &lsquo;God rested here &lsquo;.Old  people said that God lived on high altitudes, God lived in solitude. But how  high could it be? Voyager 2 is on the verge of crossing over the boundary of  our solar system and still shows no traces of God. We have been to the deepest  trenches only to find more of God&rsquo;s creations, but not God himself. <br />
  People have grown so blind that they fail to  see how far they have pushed God from themselves. God is eternally willing to  return back, he&rsquo;s just waiting for someone to take him home. God wants to walk  the city streets, wants to dine with men. God wants to talk, God wants to be  wanted. For if this was not true, He must have stopped caring long time before.<br />
  *God is neither He nor She, and God could also  be He and also she. God is a versatile actor and can take up any role you might  want to see him in. He listens to every <span dir="rtl">wish</span><span dir="ltr"> </span><span dir="ltr"> </span> and says  &lsquo;Tathastu&rsquo; (&#2340;&#2341;&#2366;&#2360;&#2381;&#2340;&#2369;)! <br />
  I mean not to insult  anybody or hurt any sentiments, all I want is people to think again. </p>
