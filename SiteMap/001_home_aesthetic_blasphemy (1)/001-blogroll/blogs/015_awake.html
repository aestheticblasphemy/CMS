<title>Awake!</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>As I flow in this stream of thought, <br />
  I fly high above the surreal realms. </p>
<p>As I ponder, over what I fought, <br />
  The futility of efforts, the aims I besought. </p>
<p>The higher I fly, the deeper I sink, <br />
  Knitting thoughts with fragile links. </p>
<p>But when dreams break, <br />
  &nbsp;there is no sound, just a little pain. </p>
<p>Clouded mind sets to wonder, <br />
  Why my dreams are fleeting away, </p>
<p>Alas! Naivety and travesty, <br />
  Are all that I have got now, </p>
<p>As I crash, headfirst, <br />
  Into a state where I am </p>
<p>Awake! </p>
