<p>My friend&rsquo;s in trouble, troubles looming  large<br />
  And I feel helpless, for my being so  unworthy,<br />
  Knowing, my company has only hope to  deliver,<br />
  But hope, sometimes is more nauseating  than frustration,<br />
  &ldquo;I am with you, my friend&rdquo;, No, this  cannot be,<br />
  Because the blame is all his to take,<br />
  He knows it, and I can&rsquo;t lie<br />
  So I distance myself from him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel anything, am I a hypocrite?<br />
  I wield different faces for different  people,<br />
  I sympathize to him, and I feel somber,<br />
  On the next curve is revelry, and all is  over?<br />
  I avoid him, a friend; solace is all I can  give to him,<br />
  When he is troubled and I feel suffocated,<br />
  I can&rsquo;t face him, because then I have to  face myself,<br />
  So I distance myself from him.</p>

<p>It was written quite long ago, when there  had been such situation. Its incomplete, and I don't think I would be put words  into it neither improve what I had written before. And I don't feel like its  poetry and won't be tagging it in that category either. Its a conversation.<br />
  I felt shackled, for being so minute, for  being just equal to nothing. People sympathizing with the sufferer, and still  not helping him in the way they could have, just because it might endanger  their reputation or they may enter wrong books? I feel it&rsquo;s better to fight on  the friend&rsquo;s side, on the side of righteousness. At least in the end, there  won&rsquo;t be any guilt that I did not try. I know I may falter on my own sayings  when I say this, but that is something I loath myself for. But at least, I feel  guilty of treason. What about others, who watch like mute spectators during the  showdown and boast of deepest philosophies and principles?</p>
