<p>I frequently receive e-mails and  messages that urge me to forward that mail or message to at least 10 different  people. They say that if I don&rsquo;t, something bad would happen to me within some  stipulated time span. Then come some e mails supporting some cause. <br />
  Recently, I received a mail  explaining that some miscreants plant HIV positive needles in common places to  hunt unwary victims. It explained how a woman got this infection in the cinema  hall when she sat on the seat and got stung by the poisoned needle. It also had  a note &ldquo;Welcome to the HIV family&rdquo;. What is this? People don&rsquo;t get infected  deliberately, and according to me, the ones who unfortunately have caught this  infection, would not be happy carrying this virus inside of them, let alone  spreading it. It&rsquo;s OK that it could make us more aware, but not always. Another  reason that I believe it to be just spam is the font selection. Why do I need  to use ridiculous font size and colour combinations just to spread awareness?  They are not eye catching; rather, they hurt. It seems, though the text says &lsquo;<em>Pay  Attention&rsquo;</em>, the page says, <em>&rsquo;I am just trying to annoy you, ignore me!&rsquo;</em> <br />
  This message started from &lsquo;X&rsquo; temple  or is the message from some saint &lsquo;Y&rsquo; and promises health, peace and success to  all those who forward it to at least 10 people in their friend list. For those  who don&rsquo;t forward it or delete it shall fall some curse. What the &hellip;.? Now God  goes tech savvy? Or has He lost the <em>&lsquo;Akaashwaani&rsquo;</em>? Or is He too lazy to  step out of his holy abode just to take care of mere mortals, the mortals he  created his own reflection?<br />
  &nbsp;I think God has better resources at his  disposal, that&rsquo;s why He&rsquo;s God! So stop worrying if you deleted a piece of such  junk mail and ventured out into the open without an umbrella. Trust him if you  believe in him. If sky&rsquo;s going to fall, then you are not the only one under it;  neither would it matter if you are carrying an umbrella or not. Veterans say,  &ldquo;God&rsquo;s stick strikes without a sound&rdquo;.&nbsp;  Regarding those mails for propagating awareness, it&rsquo;s always good to be  spread awareness, but there are better ways.<br />
  And if you want me to vote for <em>The  Taj Mahal</em> to be among the 7 wonders, just write in plain text, I&rsquo;ll do it  with all my heart as many times as you say!<br />
  The only mail or message I feel like  forwarding to all and sundry is<br />
  <em>&nbsp;&ldquo;Today is Thursday, </em><br />
  <em>Now send this message to at least 10  people in your contacts otherwise, after 7 days&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>It would again be Thursday.&rdquo;</em></p>
