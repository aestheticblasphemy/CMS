<title>Concealed Love?</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>What should  I say to make your emotions to swell?<br />
  To break  this wall of silence that stands between,<br />
  Should I  play the gambit of Forever Goodbyes?<br />
  Or should I  say nothing, just walk away?</p>
<p>What should  I say that only you would know?<br />
  Like a  sign, that what I want is you,<br />
  Emotions,  that were contained and buried,<br />
  Now ready  to bear butterfly wings, and fly to you.</p>
<p>As through  this prose, I offer you my rose,<br />
  Its refuses  to bloom, till it finds you near,<br />
  On my  knees, I implore to thee, my majesty<br />
  Would this  be enough to be a sincere propose?</p>
<p>I have  allowed you in, in somewhere deep, <br />
  A place,  not everyone is allowed to peek<br />
  And I  promise you, that I&rsquo;ll love you,<br />
  As I have,  yesterday, today and forever.</p>
