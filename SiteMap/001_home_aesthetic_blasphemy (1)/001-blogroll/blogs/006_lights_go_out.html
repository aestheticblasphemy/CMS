<title>Do these Lights ever go out?</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>Walking down the lone highway,<br />
  Under the gleaming moonlight,<br />
  Alone, and with a troubled mind I stroll,<br />
  Clouded thoughts, turbulence inside,<br />
  Still not knowing what is in my mind,<br />
  I tread along with the cool wind,<br />
  Trying to talk, with inside of Me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something is wrong&rdquo;, I know, but what?<br />
  Fast approaching, but still not enough,<br />
  Mind&rsquo;s twitching and twisting, trying to  unbind,<br />
  Ready to dash into darkness, out of confines,<br />
  But distant lights obscure the darkness,<br />
  My heart races and with anguish, wails<br />
  Ah! Do these lights ever go out?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
