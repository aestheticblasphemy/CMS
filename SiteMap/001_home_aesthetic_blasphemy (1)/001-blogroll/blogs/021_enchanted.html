<p>ENCHANTED<br />
  As she touched his face with her full palm, his  head took another spin. He had never been able to figure out what happened to  him when she was near him, blind to the world, careless to the sights and  sounds. <br />
  This night, as the group headed back from the  tour, he had requested her friend to allow him to sit by her. And as she rested  her head on his shoulders and nestled herself in his arms, he was sure that he  was dreaming. He wanted to feel his eyes, if they were really open. A dream  that was too compelling and yet, was not breaking, like all others. In a fear  that he would wake up any moment, he held her tight. <br />
  She asked <em>&ldquo;Do you want me to leave you?&rdquo;</em><br />
  A flushed face, his face changed colours as the  contours on his forehead traced his emotions. As if a tornado had hit him and  caught him in its eye, everything was in complete disarray. A symphonic chime  had just looted him of all his strength, and had left him unarmed. And what  dangerous question had it asked! Anger, fear, pleasure, pain, every emotion  twisted and churned in his gut and contorted his face.<br />
  It is surely a dream, he was convinced. But he  was afraid to wake up. Afraid, that his voice would break the spell, he said  nothing, just kept holding her. He tried to look to the other direction, but  the velvet fingers nudged his chin to her direction. Before she could inquire  any further and wake him up from this charade, he put his finger on her lips.  She smiled, and oh, he could bear it no longer. Now he wanted to believe, and  he wanted to live this moment without fear. Hopelessly he waited for the  anxiety to subside, all in vain. Perhaps, her charm was doing this to him. He  was burning. His heart was thumping and heart beat plummeting.<br />
  She grew impatient, and tried lifting her head  to see his fuller face, his reaction. He wanted to answer, but he just  couldn&rsquo;t. He wanted to spill his heart out, wanted to cry out loud, wanted to  dance in joy, wanted to twirl her around. He wanted to say &ldquo;<em>Never</em>&rdquo;, he  wanted her to be with him and wanted to be with her forever, but he just  couldn&rsquo;t speak. <br />
  Now he was afraid of himself. Unsure of his own  words, closed his eyes and kissed her forehead.<br />
  <em>&ldquo;Sleep, my angel !&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>(Lullaby)<br />
  Hush my love now don't you cry<br />
  Everything will be all right<br />
  Close your eyes and drift in dream<br />
  Rest in peaceful sleep&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br />
  Oh my love... in my arms tight<br />
  Every day you give me life<br />
  As I drift off to your world<br />
  Rest in peaceful sleep&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
