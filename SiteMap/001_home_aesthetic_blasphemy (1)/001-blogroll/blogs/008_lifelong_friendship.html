<p>A  lifelong friendship </p>
<p>Had a fight with someone too dear to lose; the series of events  that had happened in such little time had managed to keep sleep at bay. The bed  felt laid with nails and the sofa in front of the Television bitterly bit back as  I tried to distract myself. Desperate, as I stepped out of my house, a torrent  of cool air blew across me. But to no avail, it struck my bosom like a pointed  sword. Flood of emotions burst out from the subconscious. The words resonated  inside me, like a screaming. Like a sandstorm, faces, dialogues, words, emotions,  everything that could possibly hurt were swirling my head out of control. <br />
  The night, like a benevolent sorceress was incessantly trying to  soothe me. Lofty mild clouds, whistling winds, swaying trees, untiring  chirruping of the insects and the twinkling fireflies trying to burn the  darkness. But every effort it made turned out to be futile. Having tried all  the tricks to provide some respite to my agonised mind, it was left with its  last wonder. I lied down, and through shallow burning eyes, gazed up into the  open skies. <br />
  The more I gazed, the more it enticed me. Playing hide and seek  amongst the clouds, was a vast empire, trying to attract me into its majestic  domains. It appeared as if coming closer to me as moments passed by and then  engulfed me. <br />
  Did it know me? I wish I had believed! But then, it knew  everything. My hurt, my pain, my joys, my gains, my triumphs, my failures, my  self, everything. It had always known me. But that night, it was instilling me  with this new faith. Persuasively, it opened up itself upon me. The seven  sisters, the great hunter, the northern guidepost of sailors, the great square  of Pegasus, it was all enchanting. Spread across the vastness of the heavenly  canvas, was the murky Milky Way. Everything seemed to talk with me aloud, and I  spilled my heart. In a cosmic carousal, I drank new life. They knew everything  I had to complain and still they gave a patient hearing. Emotions behave in  mysterious ways. A little talk with them put an end to my unrest. It was just  the beginning of a lifelong friendship.<br />
  They suggested answers, and for the first time, I won a losing  battle against the world. </p>
