<p>A summer afternoon. The earth was dry,  parched and freckled. Cracks ran deep and reluctantly let go of the little bit  water they had.</p>
<p>The wind was warm and light, as if  deprived of its soul in the harsh, hot summer. Like a lone lover searching for  its love, wind traveled back and forth, bewildered and disheveled. The heat had  taken away the serenity and subtle coolness of the breeze and even the greenest  trees failed to put an end to its agony. Dunes of dust sifted in harmonic  patterns. The wind managed to lift a few leaves and spin them around, before  letting go.</p>
<p>Gradually, afternoon gave way to dusk  which brought fresh promises on the fringes of horizon. Soft feathery clouds  wielding the promise of satisfaction started clustering together.&nbsp; It  raised the expectations of the wind and it grew stronger. From hot, to warm, to  cool; from gentle to fast to a now rushing torrent, billowing from between the  trees and shrubs, as if searching enthusiastically, for something.</p>
<p>The skies are drawing closer as the night  is growing younger. And lo, here comes the first sign. Trickles of joyous rain.  The earth instantly springs up, sweet intoxicating fumes of dirt rise in  effervescent pleasure and the wind spreads the fragrance to every corner.</p>
<p>Like uncountable hands, earth stretches  out towards the sky, pleading like an innocent child for more. The sky lights  up and laughs aloud, gurgling through the water reserves that it holds, near,  but just too far from the outstretched hands. Playfully, it releases some,  momentarily, and then stops abruptly, just to enjoy the earth foam and fume in  excitement and anxiety. And then it laughs again, like a thousand trumpets  rolling. The earth is persistent and earnest in its demands. It has been  thirsty for long, and now wants to drink, and drink&hellip;</p>
<p>The wind that just managed to vibrate my  window sill, now threatens to take it down if I don&rsquo;t open it. As if  hypnotized, I oblige and immediately, it gushes into the room like a hungry  beast. With ferocious velocity, it rummages through the loose pages, as if  searching for someone or something in them. I watch as it majestically passes  though me like a dragon, waving and propelling, urging me to fly along.  Resisting temptation, I stay!</p>
<p>It shakes the woods vehemently, making  them shiver inside out, forcing them to shed their dead clothes, and let new  ones sprout. It carries the dead leaves with itself, before stocking them away,  along the ridgeline.</p>
<p>And just when the earth can take it no  longer, skies throw open their gates. It rains, and rains to the earth&rsquo;s  delight. Water seeps in every crack and crevice. It rains to seed new life in  trees, supplying juice for new saplings to thrive. As I stand there in shade,  wind carries the rain to me too. It wets my window pane, and some drops reach  my eyes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which rain caused the  moisture in my eyes. But as I clear my eyes of their rain, I smile, content  that finally, it rained!</p>
