<title>Feels like déjà vu !</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>I feel that I have been here before! I have seen this happen before! <br />
  Many times, I have felt this feeling surge inside me. Sometimes it  stays, sometimes it bursts like a bubble and is lost. But I am assured that I  have experienced it before.<br />
  It happens to me sometimes. I am sitting with my friends, busy  gossiping, and then suddenly something triggers it. I go mute for a while and  it feels like memories of a similar incident flooding into my mind. I know what  is going to happen next, but I just can&rsquo;t remember, or maybe it just happens in  parallel at the speed of thought. Everything&rsquo;s just conforming to the plot  sequence.&nbsp; <br />
  Sometimes, in the classroom, teacher is scribbling on the board,  eloquently explaining why things happen. Suddenly, something inside tells me  that I have done this before. I drift away from the class into some strange  dimension. I can hear the teacher&rsquo;s voice like a chanting, resonating in the  same way it had before, when I had learned it. <br />
  I am on a stroll with my friend, somebody of their acquaintance comes  over and we stop. The two are talking over something I am least concerned. I  start looking around. What I see, the way I see it, it has been done before. As  if, I had been standing right there in the same way some time in the past, and  now a distant memory is surfacing.<br />
  Science says it&rsquo;s my brains playing games with me, and explains it  satisfactorily. Still, science has not ever analyzed a real d&eacute;j&agrave; vu case. So  whatever it is, is still unknown and till then I just want to be mesmerized  everytime.</p>
