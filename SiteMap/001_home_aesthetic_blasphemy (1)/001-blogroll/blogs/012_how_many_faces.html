<title>How many faces?</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>I admire ye  for what I despise thee,<br />
  Undecided  of what is amiss,<br />
  My pride or  thy prejudice?</p>
<p>Entwined in  me, like a climber to the tree<br />
  This love,  this hate, like the venom of a snake.<br />
  Kills me,  inside, slowly!</p>
<p>I lack the  passion, to hate for a lifetime,<br />
  Yet,  there&rsquo;s less reason for me to be considerate,<br />
  The lust to  ape ye, ephemeral!</p>
<p>Wielding  two faces, an albatross burgeoning,<br />
  And now I  see your multifaceted dimensions,<br />
  Just to  stand in awe, anguish and disgust!</p>
<p>I ain&rsquo;t any  actor, and I fail to pretend,<br />
  And when I  see you change accent,<br />
  Forgive me,  but my temper does swell!</p>
<p>This poison  in me, is too compelling,<br />
  But my  conscience&rsquo;s mockery is too harsh a shriek,<br />
  And this,  keeps me,</p>
<p>&nbsp;From becoming weak!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I admire ye for what I despise thee, <br />
  Undecided of what is amiss, <br />
  My pride or thy prejudice?</p>
