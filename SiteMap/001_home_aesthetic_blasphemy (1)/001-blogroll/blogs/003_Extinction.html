  Save  tigers, elephants</p>
<p>I am also  unique. Save me. Or else I will also go extinct. Tiger  population in 30 Tiger reserves in the country have dwindled to 1,411 at  present from the 1,800 in 1972, </p>

<p>according to statistics. <br />
  <br />
  The country had 40,000 tigers in 1900, statistics released by CPR Environmental  Education Centre (CPREEC), which is organising an exhibition titled &quot;Tiger  Tiger&quot;, on Sunday said. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;The habitats have been lost due to severe deforestation, contributing to  the dwindling tiger numbers,&quot; it said. <br />
  <br />
  Non-forestry activities, fragmentation of forest patches were the major causes  for the dwindling tiger population, it said. The exhibition sought to raise  awareness about the need to save the tiger. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;This would also provide a complete overview of the National animal -- its  evolution, behaviour, social structure, cultural role, ecological significance,  human impact upon it and what should be done to conserve it,&quot; it said.<br />
  Elephants are being killed for their ivory at such a rate  that most large groups could be extinct by 2020, researchers warned. Dr Wasser  said the loss of the animals will have a negative impact on their ecosystem and  other wildlife that depend on it - as well as on the cashflow they generate  from tourists.<br />

  <strong>Poaching driven by increasing demand for tiger parts </strong><br />
  One of most deadly threats facing the tiger in India poaching for tiger  parts. According to the <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/news/sunday-toi/special-report/This-may-be-the-last-time-you-see-a-tiger/articleshow/4872542.cms" target="_blank">Times of India</a>, a single tiger &ldquo;ground down and separated  into various medicines&rdquo; brings in around $50,000. Belinda Wright of the  Wildlife Protection Society of India said in the article that poachers use  Nepal to move between India and China, where increasing demand for tiger parts  is driven by rising affluence:<br />

  . It&rsquo;s a real shame that we have disgraced Mother  Nature and are incessantly robbing her of her aura. Never have we found time to  stop and think where is it leading us to? But then what about our nature? Isn&rsquo;t  our nature entwined with the Nature around us? Creativity, culture, society,  traditions, religion, science and what not started off from the Terra Firma. In  pursuit of exploiting Nature to the farthest extent, we have forgotten that  this has lead to our plight. And now it&rsquo;s the battle for our own existence.<br />

  1400 Tigers left in natural habitat in India; elephants of Africa predicted  to go extinct by 2020. Causes, both human and inhuman. <br />

  But they are not the only species that need help and I think they should  grow up to take care of themselves before it&rsquo;s too late. The apes realized this  and made themselves worthy of being the test subjects in laboratories. Now they  are bred in captivity, so no extinction issues.<br />
  Meanwhile, I too am facing serious extinction issues. These issues occupy  my otherwise vacant mind for hours. This particular homo-sapiens genus of  hominini tribe has learned a lot. But only a small lot amongst this group knows  its roots, it&rsquo;s Terra Firma. They have forgotten that everything new doesn&rsquo;t  pour out from the sky. It is learnt from the roots, from the basics. Science as  we call it.<br />
  They taught  me words after teaching me the alphabets, and then I made sentences, convinced  that these were mere arrangements of words. From sentences emerged emotions. But  now, it is all history. Today, they rough me up through superconductivity  course without telling me if it is a special case of conductivity. Schrodinger  equations are used like (x+y) and we are expected to know it all. They have  made education a compulsion for me, not a delight. The best subject,  mathematics, was transformed from a deep reasoning subject to mere cramming of  rules and results. Electrostatics, electromagnetic fields and antennas are  taught as if they are all different fields of study.<br />
  Just to show  how they have stopped using their upper storey, let me narrate to you a personal  experience. In a lecture on &lsquo;Growth of Industrial Sociological Approach&rsquo;, the lecturer  explains how F.W. Taylor propounded &lsquo;Scientific principles of Management&rsquo;, the  first one being &lsquo;Science, not the rule of the thumb&rsquo; <a href="http://www.rajputbrotherhood.com/knowledge-hub/business-studies/scientific-management.html"><em>[More  Info]</em></a>. But the comma after &lsquo;Science&rsquo; was missing and turned  this statement into &lsquo;Science not the rule of the thumb&rsquo;. And our respected  lecturer explained it as such, though the lecturer was an MBA graduate from a  top institute. The statement that was supposed to mean, use science and not the  rule of the thumb, was transformed into, science is not the rule of the thumb.  F.W. Taylor&rsquo;s spirit would have died again of a heart attack if it was  wandering around us.<br />
  Is this how  they are going to treat the lone piece of my kind? Is this how they intend to  curb me and my natural instincts? Foundations of science &ndash; What, how and why,  are reserved and forbidden words. I ask too much, they screw my grades. I ask  too little, I&rsquo;d rather suffocate. A few understand my situation, fewer help,  others encourage me to join ranks. <br />
  By making me  like themselves, they think they can save me from extinction. But when they could  not save their original self from extinction and succumbed to the tyranny of  the system, how can they do justice to me? <br />
  A single poached tiger &ldquo;ground down and separated into  various medicines&rdquo; brings in around $50,000. A kilogram of Ivory can fetch you  around <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6677444">700$</a>. Neither my bones nor my skin would  fetch you anything greater than a trifle. <br />
  Though my  extinction might not disturb the ecosystem, I might not be the bringer of  rains, I might be adding just one species to the biodiversity, but still I am  unique, am I not? <br />
  So save  Tigers, save elephants and SAVE ME!<br />
  *Note:  We all are unique in some way or the other. Only a few exist in the world who  shall try to make us climb the glory mountain. Rest are there to push us down  into the well of obscurity and ordinarity. God gave us brains not to preserve  but to use to help ourselves and those mute animals who cannot speak for  themselves.</p>
