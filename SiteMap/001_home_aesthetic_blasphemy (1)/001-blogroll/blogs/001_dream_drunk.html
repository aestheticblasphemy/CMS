<p><strong>Dream is a weird  phenomenon!</strong><br />
  A battle has been  fought; a whole day has passed drearily. I wake up only to find that it&rsquo;s just  15 minutes since I slept.<strong></strong><br />
  Dreams defy many  earthly laws. Whatever we see, whatever we do is stored in one small lump and  pops out uncanny manifestations. Like a painter&rsquo;s plate, events blend in so  finely that the one seeing them can only be mesmerized by his hidden  creativity.<br />
  Locations converge,  feats are performed and anything is permitted. We conjure up images of people  we have never seen, sometimes, not even talked to them. These images go animate  in this world. Everything seems so clear, and yet so confusing.<br />
  And what when we  wake up? Sometimes we remember, and sometimes we forget.<br />
  I remember myself  trapped in a sleeping bag, falling off from the bed. I was dreaming that I had  fallen off a cliff and never reached ground. I had learnt to fly. Free fall is  exhilarating, feels like it should never end. Soon the dream gave way to the  shattering reality. Like a caterpillar, I tussle to climb up the bed, head  first.<br />
  Sometimes, I see so  clearly in dreams. I have solved problems which I have never seen in my life  before. I remember a few when I wake up all of a sudden. Though, by the time, I  pull out&nbsp;a notepad to jot down the fragments of genius, its gone. My  friends have heard me blurting out some mathematics in sleep. I never heard  myself though.<br />
  English has never  been my first language. Even though I hear English music, I need to concentrate  very hard to decipher the lyrics by listening till I memorize them. But during  the transition between consciousness and sleep, I hear each word, crisp and  clear.<br />
  Dreams are dear to  me, and I would love having them. The only regret being, I can live them, enjoy  them, but not exploit them.</p>
