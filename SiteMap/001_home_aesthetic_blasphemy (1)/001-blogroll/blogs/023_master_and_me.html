<p>Master:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come  in, my lad!<br />
  I:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  How did you know it is me, I had not knocked yet?<br />
  Master:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As  if you don&rsquo;t know! Well, you have some questions, don&rsquo;t you?<br />
  I:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ah, you know everything. Then do I need to air my thoughts, you already know  what I seek.<br />
  Master:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Well&hellip; yeah&hellip; I created you, so of course I know it, but then, why did I create  you in the first place? If you keep asking questions in your mind and only I do  the talking, then what fun would be it? I did not create ye all to hone my  commentary skills.<br />
  I:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Okay, okay&hellip; I got the point. <br />
  Master:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So what troubles you this time?<br />
  I:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  You know me, random things concern me most of the times, and I need to run to  you most of the time for the answers. This time I was thinking&hellip;about judgment&hellip;.<br />
  Master:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Soo&hellip;What about it?<br />
  I:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Well, when do we get to decide? And when do we decide it fairly? Being human,  it is very complex to decide between the heart and mind. Reason, is often  derived from experiences, but then, all experiences are novel in themselves,  looking alike, but all different. How do we get to see things, while staying  unrelated to them? Like seeing from the outside?<br />
  Master:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Young one, what makes you think so? What troubles you? <br />
  I:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Master, you have stayed alone for a very long while, you know how things  revolve when we start looking at things from our past, when we are alone.  Family, friends, people we&rsquo;ve met, incidences, decisions, regrets, faults,  happiness, successes, everything, every deed no matter how trivial it might  have seemed back then, rises from somewhere, like a chest of memories has just  been unlocked. Let&rsquo;s say, I also got some free time to kill.<br />
  Master:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Well thank Me for my being lonely, or else you could have never made it into  the world. Rather, this world wouldn&rsquo;t have been there. But yes, I get the  point. So, why do you want the answer to it anyway? I forgive often for  follies, don&rsquo;t I?<br />
  I:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hah, you kidding me? You sit behind these curtains and don&rsquo;t allow me in. Always  saying that I have a long way to go, and when I am trying to arrange for some  transportation for the journey, you are puncturing my tires by this hypnotic  talk? This isn&rsquo;t fair Master! You forgive because You, are You, Our Master!<br />
  Master:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  You are such a baby; I was just trying to wiggle your cheeks, they are sooo&hellip;  human!<br />
  I:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  That&rsquo;s not funny, I am a baby anyways. Do you want me to throw in a tantrum or  you answering me straight?<br />
  Master:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (Sigh) Judging is not a very enjoyable experience. It forbids you to let any  emotion from indulging in what you intend to judge. Like a glass sheet. You  need to be aware of everything around it, and still remain aloof of everything.  You should feel no pain, no pleasure, no feeling at all when you sit to judge  something. It&rsquo;s like being an aggressor, ruthless, always looking for weakness,  fallacies, and at the same time, searching for the good points. It&rsquo;s  benchmarking against your own self. You cannot judge what you have no idea  about. To be rational, you have to do away with pain, pleasure, emotions and  regressions, and to judge, you have to be at least one step above of it. <br />
  I:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So what about us? No one can be like you, imparting justice that is really, <strong>just</strong>.  Our prejudices hold us, our hearts sway us sometimes. How can we rise above  that? They say that when in conflict flip a coin, as it gives time to know what  we wish to see.<br />
  Master:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Oh I see, I gave free will to men so that no one follows the rulebook. This  saves me the pain of drafting one. This thing called heart, though another  faculty of mind messes up with this free will through emotion. And for that  coin flipping, I would suggest using a blank coin, the one with no options.<br />
  I:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  How? I mean how are&hellip;<br />
  Master:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Now I ain&rsquo;t here to spoon feed you with every answer, am I? I have given you a  head start, now you wade alone. I&rsquo;ll just recline and watch you learn. <em>Use  your brain, child, the brain feels no pain, neither pleasure!</em><br />
  I:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Whaaat? But Father, that&hellip;<br />
  Master:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Blasphemous, Leave now, there&rsquo;s work unto you, be blessed and wake up now, its  day break.</p>
<p>Master: Blasphemous,  Leave now, there&rsquo;s work unto you, be blessed and wake up now, its day break.  Read complete conversation at http://aestheticblasphemy.blogspot.com</p>
