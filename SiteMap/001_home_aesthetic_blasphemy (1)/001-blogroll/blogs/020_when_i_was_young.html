<p>Oh I scaled those lofty mountains,<br />
  And plunged deep into ocean&rsquo;s den,<br />
  I scathed the crusts of the snowy tundra,<br />
  And wandered in the Sahara, under the raining sun;</p>
<p>I hunted with the lions,<br />
  And hopped with the hares,<br />
  I soared with the eagles,<br />
  Like gulls, dived to hunted despair;</p>
<p>Bears and me, stole honey form the hornets,<br />
  Butterflies and me, danced along rivulets,<br />
  Sunflowers and me, raced from sun dawn to sun down,<br />
  Life didn&rsquo;t care, and I cared no less;</p>
<p>Oh how I loved to play with myself,<br />
  Throw a ball high and go play fetch,<br />
  Oh how I loved talking to myself,<br />
  Sending postcards to myself everyday;</p>
<p>When I was Young!!</p>
